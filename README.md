Hello there! This is another mini project of mine. It calculates the factorial a number.

I really liked the statistics and got to work with a lot of permutations during my last winter semester at the Uni zu KÃ¶ln. My calculator could never really calculate any factorials greater than 10 and that really annoyed me. That is why I decided to code this little program that does it well. 
Instead of int or long that can only calculate first 13 and 21 numbers respectively, I decided to use the BigInteger class. BigInteger doesn't have a theoretical limit and can allocate as much memory as it needs for all of data it is asked to hold. So you can calculate pretty huge factorials!

The program has 2 methods of calculating a factorial: 
1) Iteration and
2) Recursion

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
